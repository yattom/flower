Flower and Leaves should use Growth.
Create PlantParams as a convenient parameter storage.
Flower generates seeds which will eventually leave and plant themselves.
 Refactor out stamen and pistil from flower.
Move the workspace to CraftTable
 Automate tests with nose
 Automate deploy
Plants need interactions between physically surrounding environment (air, earth.)
 Leaves take in mygen from air.
  refactor out WorldEntityRepository from World
  add EnvironmentalGrid
  put every WorldEntity into an EnvironmentalGrid
 Roots take moisture and heplon from earth or liquid water
  EnvironmentalGrid has type
  distinguish between liquid water and moisture as a material
  water flow
 Environment should be whole
  let EnvironmentalGrids linked with each other
  Grids exchange materials naturally
Pollens must float in air and eventually reach other flowers.
WorldEntity should have ids for persistance.
Logical way to exchange materials between entities/grids/etc.
